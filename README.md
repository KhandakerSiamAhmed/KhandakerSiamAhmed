## Abstract

I am a fifth-semester undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering with a strong focus on bridging mechanical systems with intelligent control. My research interests lie in **Robotics**, **Control Theory**, and **Fluid Mechanics**. I have extensive experience in CAD modeling, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and embedded systems, actively contributing to competitive robotics projects including Mars rovers and autonomous underwater vehicles.
